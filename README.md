# iOS-Store-App

In this app, I have integrated a UIKit application with a JSON API. I have consumed multiple endpoints of a third party api and perform GET, POST and DELETE operations. I have injected SwiftUI views into a UIKit application and visualize UIKit controllers using Xcode previews. In this app, I have also created generic network layer.
